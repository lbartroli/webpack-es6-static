# WEBPACK - ES6 - EXPRESS - MONGOOSE - BOOTSTRAP
## Boilerplate for static pages

I've been looking for a boilerplate like this one for so long, but none fit my needs, so I decided to build my own boilerplate. 

Maybe it will be useful for you too.

Feel free to send any recommendation or doubt to my [email](mailto:lgbartroli@gmail.com).

>### Run webpack-dev-server with HMR ***(on localhost:3000)***
```
$ npm start
```

>### Build and run files for production ***(on localhost:8080)***
```
$ npm run start:prod
```

>+ Configure your MongoDB settings in ***/backend/config/db.js***

>+ Configure your Express settings in ***/backend/config/express.js***

>+ Configure your Server settings in ***/backend/config/server.js***

>+ Add your modules inside ***/backend/mdoules*** and configure them in ***/backend/router.js***

>+ This Boilerplate use *Swig* with *Consolidate*, so you need to add your views inside ***/frontend/src/views***

>+ Your webpack entry files, should be included inside ***/frontend/src/modules***

## Enjoy.
